# Simply MORE Love (StepMania 5)
Forked from https://github.com/dguzek/Simply-Love-SM5, "MORE" attempts to bring additional modifications in form of player-modifiers or machine-options to the best stepmania theme in the world. MORE means MORE: all additions to dguzek's work stay intact (and defaulted in most cases), and a player can choose via modifiers to get (literally) Simply MORE Love.

MORE #1:
The "Receptor Arrows Position" modifier (StomperZ|ITG) in "Extra Modifiers" was an exclusive modifier for StomperZ. Now it isn't exclusive anymore, and available in any game mode. Plus, the "ITG" position in reverse scroll has been slightly updated to provide the same distance towards the "StomperZ" as in standard scroll.

Ideas:
- Y-Position for Combo & Judgment as a modifier.
- in-game gui mods as a modifier (e.g. slim ui elements to make more vertical playfield space available)
- rethink where to place all the MORE modifiers. one idea is to have a global machine modifier which enables or disables the MORE features/modifiers in a non-destructive way within a "MORE Options" mod-menu-page
